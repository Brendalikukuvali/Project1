  <h1 class="about">ABOUT US</h1>
<p>We are an NGO organisation working on poverty eradication and community development for poor and low/-income households in Malaysia. With its four modules of Supporting Basic Needs, Providing Basic Community Services, Rehabilitation & Building of Homes and Supporting Sustainable Livelihoods, Sejahtera assisted more than 8,000 poor families since its inception in 2009. Focusingcommunity adoption and uplifting the community it works in, Sejahtera aims to provide a holistic approach in community development by addressing different groups - Adults, Youth and Children - for a more comprehensive assistance to those needing it most.</p>
<p>Our aim is to continue looking ahead in increasing its efforts in poverty eradication in Malaysia. We will strive to seek ways, not only to help participants earn additional income, enhance the educational experience and improve living conditions by equipping them with basic living necessities, but also hopefully give them the awareness, realization as well as opportunities to believe that poverty is not a condition they have been destined to live in.
  Our target group at Sejahtera is the low-income based on the national Poverty Line Index (PLI), the official indicator that measures poverty. Like any developing country, pockets of extreme poverty still exist. There are families that have slipped through the cracks who would benefit from a helping hand. This is what we do, with the support of caring individuals and corporates.</p>
